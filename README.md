THE ODING PROJECT (ONLINE-LIBRARY PROJECT)

This project was made with vanilla Js/Html/Css/Vite/Firebase.
Great learning experience because i get to use and learn about vite and firebase for the first time to produce this project.

Vite: https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html
firebase: https://firebase.google.com

The project started very simple and got complicated along the way where the original idea was to simply make a project where the user can add a book(simple form where the user can add a title/page number/author/...) to his/her collection and save it in the localsorage but of course that didn't happen because i wanted the project to look like real website as much as possible instead of simple form and localstorage, and by adding a landing page and fetching books form an external API i was able to demonstrat my knowlage in diferent areas

1. Responsive design using (media query, flexbox , grid)
2. Using fetch API to fetch data from an external APIs
3. Using / implementing build tool like Vite into the project
4. Connecting the project to firebase database && authentication service

Now to use the project it is very simple you need to authenticate with your google account to get access to myBook page and to add books from the newBooks page to your collection(myBooks page), after adding the books you can toggle the read/not read state of the book by clicking the button underneth the book and you can also delete a book from your collection and therefore from the database.
